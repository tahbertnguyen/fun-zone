            desc="Despite the bad weather, Captain Willem van der Decken set out to sea with his ship De Hollander looking for wealth and riches. His greed was so great, that he ordered his crew to sail on Easter Sunday, although it was forbidden. Since that day, everyone on board is doomed to sail forever on the seven seas. Nowadays, the red-sailed ship is still sailing around the world... people called it De Vliegende Hollander."
